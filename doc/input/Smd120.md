# Using SMD120 modbus energy meter as the input source

To use a SMD120 modbus energy meter via a Protos PE11 as an input source, set up the `/etc/uni-meter.conf` file as
follows:

```hocon
uni-meter {
  output = "uni-meter.output-devices.shelly-pro3em"
  
  input = "uni-meter.input-devices.smd120"

  input-devices {
    smd120 {
      port = 8899

      # The Marstek storage needs input data on a single phase. This can be controlled by
      # the configuration options below
      power-phase-mode = "mono-phase"
      power-phase = "l1"
    }
  }
}
```
